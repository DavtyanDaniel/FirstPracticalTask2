coordinates._ 

_The script is accepting parameters that you can write in <span style="color: green"> input.ini </span> file._

_List of parameters_

_<span style="color: yellow"> NumberOfStars </span> - Is the number of the brightest stars in the given FOV._

_<span style="color: yellow"> RA, DEC </span> - are the coordinates that you give for know the center of FOV._

_<span style="color: yellow"> Fov_h, Fov_v </span> - are the horizontal and vertical FOVs._

_<span style="color: yellow"> FileName </span> - is the name of <span style="color: green">_ .tsv </span> file in current directory.
